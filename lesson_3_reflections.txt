Reflection file for lesson 3

When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate my work with colleague or to save my file in cloud to ensure that won't lost due to computer problem.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it is more reasonable to pull changes in your files when you have a meaningful change in your code, and that only be decided properly manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks is to create a copy of a github repository to another repository in different spot in github that will allow you to modify it as your own. Clone is to create a copy of the github repository in your computer. Branches is to split your files into many different category of working so that it can work separately, and merge after if needed

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To check whether other collaborator have changed your file content or not, to decice how to synch correctly your work with github repository
