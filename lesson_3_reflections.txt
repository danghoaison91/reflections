Reflection file for lesson 3

When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate my work with colleague or to save my file in cloud to ensure that won't lost due to computer problem.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it is more reasonable to pull changes in your files when you have a meaningful change in your code, and that only be decided properly manually.
